# MA8463_NumericalLinearAlgebra
Class taken at MSU in Fall 2022 | Mostly homework scripts

The class was almost entirely in Python and was equal parts written problems, proofs, and coding assignments.

Most coding assignments were simple one-off scripts separated according to problems numbers. Nevertheless, many should be reusable for different input since I went for a bare minimum level of atomization.
